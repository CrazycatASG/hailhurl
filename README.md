# this is the old version lol, you can find the newer version codeberg.org/crazycatasg/hailhurl

HailHurl (derivied from **Hail**'s **H**elpful **U**seful AU**R** He**l**per) is a extremely simple AUR helper, which follows Unix
philosophy, to make each program do one thing well.
In this case, it handles your AUR packages with ease and minimalism.
The program is still highly in alpha, there's no solid releases, and there's a lot of features missing, so please be aware of that
